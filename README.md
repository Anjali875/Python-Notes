# Python-Notes
In Python, REPL stands for Read-Eval-Print Loop. It is an interactive programming environment that allows you to execute Python code one line or block at a time and see the results immediately. This is particularly useful for testing, debugging, or learning Python.
This little Python program uses the pyttsx3 library, which is a text-to-speech conversion library in Python: 
import pyttsx3 
engine = pyttsx3.init() 
engine.say("go study!") 
engine.runAndWait()
string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes. it can be sliced for getting a part of string, that is called 'String slicing'.
Index in a string starts from 0 (for backwards, it starts from -1).
Syntax for string slicing= s1= name[ind_start:ind_end]
Changes to existing string can't be done.
'str' object does not support item assignment.
strings are immutable.
